ios app for interval training, logging and sharing exercises.

### What is Interval Training?
Interval training involves doing an exercise for a set, typically short period of time, followed by a set resting time period, and then repeating this process for a set number of times.


### What Can I Use This App for?
The Stopwatch tab of the app operates similarly to the iPhoneâ€™s Stopwatch with the additional functionality of being able to set an Active Interval time, Rest Interval time and number of Intervals. One sound is played when each active interval ends, another for each rest interval and one when the set number of intervals ends. This allows you to precisely time your interval workout. The other primary use is to log all of your workouts and their respective exercises, including customisable metrics and progression insights over time.
